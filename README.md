# User-Profiling-and-Segmentation
User profiling is the method of creating a detailed description of an individual based on various aspects like personal information, characteristics, interests, online behavior, and relevant attributes. In this scenario, a dataset with 1,000 user profiles and 16 features has been provided, encompassing demographics (age, gender, income, education), online activities (likes, followed accounts, device usage), engagement metrics (time online on weekdays/weekends, click-through/conversion rates), ad interactions (time spent), and user interests.

The goal is to build a robust user profiling and segmentation system using machine learning and data analysis techniques. By examining user interaction data, demographics, and engagement metrics, meaningful patterns and clusters within the user base are identified. This system helps businesses tailor their advertising campaigns to specific segments, enhancing ad relevance, user engagement, conversion rates, and optimizing ad spend.
